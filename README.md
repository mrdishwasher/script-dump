# ROBLOX-Script-Dump
All the scripts I've made from vulnerabilities I've found in games.
You can feel free to do anything with the script as long as it is bound by the license.

FOR GAME DEVELOPERS:
If I've posted a script that has exploited a vulnerability in your game, feel free to use it to make your game more secure.
